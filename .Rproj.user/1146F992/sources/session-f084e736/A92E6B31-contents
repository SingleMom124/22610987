```{r}

rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.

# Organizing the main README:

This README he will be grading so it is important that the code are sourced here appropriately and figures displayed properly.

First create the project as you normally would...

```{r}
# Copy directory and run

fmxdat::make_project(Open = T)

```

... Now, Nico says that he likes each question and their code to be in separate folders. More specifically, creating functions for what I am trying to achieve in each question and placing them in the code folders, sourcing them where appropriate.

Nico provided code to do this. I Modified it as follows...

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Now creating separate folders with Texavier files...

Texevier::create_template(directory = "C:/R_Stuff/Data_Science_Moc/22610987", template_name = "Question1")
Texevier::create_template(directory = "C:/R_Stuff/Data_Science_Moc/22610987", template_name = "Question2")
Texevier::create_template(directory = "C:/R_Stuff/Data_Science_Moc/22610987", template_name = "Question3")
Texevier::create_template(directory = "C:/R_Stuff/Data_Science_Moc/22610987", template_name = "Question4")

# I've set this to not run again as the folders are already created. Dont need to include this in the prac.
```

Now unzip all of the data and put them in their respective question data folders.

... From here you can start with the questions.

### Question 1:

So remember to call your functions from the code folders of the question you are answering.

```{r}
# First calling the functions from my question 1 code folder...

library(tidyverse)
list.files('Question1/code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))

# Running the function...

data <- reader("Question1/data")
```

## Question 1.a:

```{r}

# Box and whisker plot...

a_plot <- plotter(data)
print(a_plot)

```
## Question 1.b:

Decomposition bar graph...

```{r}

b_plot <- decomposer(data)
print(b_plot)

# Still need to figure out how to arrange and put SA first
```
## Question 2:

Loading functions and data...

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
list.files('Question2/code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))

data <- read_rds("Question2/data/WineMag.rds")
```


First doing the bar plot and the table...

```{r}
plot2a <- bar_plotter(data)
print(plot2a)

table2a <- word_table(data)
print(table2a)
```
